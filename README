Introduction
============

Before anything at all: There is no official release yet. Although
it only lacks some actions and events, so it's not that bad really ;).

PAMI means PHP Asterisk Manager Interface. As its name suggests its just a
set of php classes that will let you issue commands to an ami and/or receive
events, using an observer-listener pattern.

The idea behind this, is to easily implement operator consoles, monitors, etc.
either via SOA or ajax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asterisk versions supported
===========================
PAMI is tested in asterisk 1.6 versions, just because this is the version
I use in my boxes. If you need support for other versions, please contact me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example
=======
Please see docs/examples/quickstart/example.php for a very basic example.

Currently Supported Events
==========================
More events will be added with time. I can only add the ones I can test for and
use, so your contributions may make the difference! ;)

Unknown (not yet implemented) events will be reported as UnknownEvent, so you
can still catch them. If you catch one of these, please report it!
